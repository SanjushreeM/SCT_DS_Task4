# SCT_DS_Task4
# 🚦 Task 04 - Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship**.  
The objective is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

- Road conditions  
- Weather conditions  
- Time of day  
- Accident hotspot locations  

The analysis helps understand contributing factors to road accidents and visualizes key insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze traffic accident dataset  
- Identify patterns in weather, road surface, and time of day  
- Visualize accident hotspot areas  
- Generate meaningful insights using data visualization  

---

## 📂 Dataset
**File Name:** `RTA Dataset.csv`  
**Source:** Road Traffic Accidents from Kaggle

The dataset contains information about:
- Weather conditions  
- Road surface conditions  
- Light conditions  
- Accident severity  
- Accident location  
- Time and day of accidents  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Visualizations Performed
✔ Accidents by Weather Conditions  
✔ Accidents by Road Surface Conditions  
✔ Accidents by Time of Day (Hour-wise)  
✔ Top 10 Accident Hotspot Areas  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Most accidents occur during **clear weather and dry road conditions**  
- **Evening and late-night hours** show higher accident frequency  
- Certain areas consistently appear as **accident hotspots**  
- Driver behavior plays a major role in accident occurrence
